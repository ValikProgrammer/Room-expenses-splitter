## Flask Docker simple app

### Preparation

Test that the server on Flask works without Docker.

### Docker container running

 - Fill in the Dockerfile
 - Build the image, assigning it a tag for Docker Hub.
 - Run the container from the image you just built, forwarding the port from the host machine to the container port. Choose the port yourself; it can be the same or different.
 - Check that the application is working.

### DockerHub

 - Run the command docker login in the terminal and enter your Docker Hub login and password.
 - Upload your image to Docker Hub.
 - Go to your profile at https://hub.docker.com/ and check.
